# A/B Testing with Flask & Google Analytics

## About
This project demonstrates a simple A/B testing setup using a Flask web app to evaluate the effectiveness of a landing page in driving user engagement. Visitors are randomly served either a version of the page **with** a landing section or **without**, and their behavior is tracked using **Google Analytics**. The goal is to assess whether the landing component improves user retention and activity.

> Created for educational purposes to explore A/B testing and user behavior tracking with minimal infrastructure.
